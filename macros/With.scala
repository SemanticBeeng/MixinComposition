/**
 * `With` is a type class that can be used for the evidence that two types `A` and `B`
 * can be composed. It has a method `apply` that, provided instances of `A` and `B`
 * creates the intersection `A with B` by delegation.
 *
 * This composition is right biased. As such, equally named methods in `B` will always
 * override methods in `A`.
